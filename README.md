# Hotel Booking Trend Analysis

### Executive Summary
This report presents a comprehensive analysis of hotel booking trends in Portugal spanning from 2015 to 2017. We investigate customer behavior patterns, identify high/low demand seasons, and explore countries contributing the most tourists. 

By delving into the trends within the hospitality industry, we aim to discern the underlying factors influencing hotel demand. This understanding is crucial for pinpointing the most cost-efficient seasons for hotel bookings, especially for individuals navigating budget constraints. Additionally, gaining insights into industry dynamics and customer behavior patterns provides valuable exposure to real-world marketing analytics.

This analysis concentrates on unraveling the intricacies behind hotel booking cancellations, investigating dimensions such as the types of hotels with the highest cancellations, peak cancellation and no-show periods, predominant distribution channels responsible for cancellations, and deposit types correlated with increased cancellation rates.

Furthermore, we explore patterns in family travel bookings, examining monthly trends in family reservations, outcomes of family bookings, special room type requests, and the meal preferences of families. This multifaceted analysis equips stakeholders with actionable insights into the factors driving cancellations and the unique characteristics of family travel bookings in the Portuguese hospitality landscape.
